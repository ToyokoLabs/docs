How to use gsutil to manage files
=================================


To copy, move or delete files from your machine to a Google Storage, you can use the Google GUI (aka Google Cloud Console) or the **gsutil** command. This tutorial explains the installation and use of gsutil to handle files in the command line.

Before installing **gsutil**, let's create a bucket using the Google Cloud Console.


Go to storage
-------------

In the Google Cloud Console, go to Storage and then Browse:

---------------

Press CREATE BUCKET button in the console:

Next step is to name the bucket. Since the name must be unique, a good idea is to use a domain name, for example myuniquename.toyoko.io, change toyoko.io for your domain, then press CONTINUE.

Next step is to select the region. Unless you have a specific needs, choose *Region* in Location Type and *us-west-1 (Oregon)* in Location.

In the *access control*, select *Fine-grained*.

In *Advanced Settings* leave the encryption as *Google-manage key* and press **CREATE**.

After this, the bucket is created, so you can upload files to it.


Install gsutil (as part of Google Cloud SDK)
--------------------------------------------

Install following this guide according to your OS:

https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install

Once the Google Cloud SDK is installed run the gcloud init command and follow the prompt (this may include opening a web page and log in with you Google account linked to your CGP project).

Check that **gsutil** is intalled by running (note you may have a different version):

```
$ gsutil --version
gsutil version: 4.47
```

Simple upload
-------------

To upload a file to a bucket in the command line use the gsutil command this way:

```
gsutil cp <YOUR_LOCAL_FILE> gs://<BUCKET_NAME>
```

So if your local file is called *readme.md* and your bucket is called *storage.balseiro.toyoko.io*, the command will look like: 


```
gsutil cp "readme.txt" gs://storage.balseiro.toyoko.io
```

Use of quotes are mandatory when the file name has white spaces.

This simple upload can work for large files since it has built-in resume, that means that if the upload is interrupted, the next try is intented it will continue the upload from the last chunck instead of starting over.

To upload large files (>250Mb) it is advisable to do it in multiple parts using the configuration shown in next section
